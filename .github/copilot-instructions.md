## Deployment

The project supports dual deployment options for maximum flexibility and reliability:

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The project automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment workflow:
1. Triggers on pushes to main branch
2. Sets up GitHub Pages environment
3. Uploads the entire repository as static content
4. Deploys to the configured Pages URL

### Netlify Deployment
The project is also configured for Netlify deployment with `netlify.toml`:
1. **Static Site Configuration**: No build process required since it's a single HTML file
2. **Security Headers**: Includes security headers for XSS protection and content security
3. **SPA Routing**: Configured to serve `index.html` for all routes
4. **Manual or Git Integration**: Can be deployed manually by dragging files or connecting to GitHub

#### Setting up Netlify Deployment
1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. **Build Settings**: 
   - Build command: `echo 'Static site deployment - no build required'`
   - Publish directory: `.` (root directory)
3. **Deploy**: Netlify will automatically deploy on pushes to main branch

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All changes committed and pushed to main branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully (for GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Super-linter passes all checks
- [ ] Live site updates within 5-10 minutes
- [ ] Test live site functionality after deployment
- [ ] Verify Netlify deployment if using dual deployment

## Workflow & Collaboration

## Getting Started

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lordturtle96/Nexus-Singularity-.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser, or serve via HTTP server:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Simple Python server
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Option 2: Node.js server (if available)
   npx serve .
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:8000 to view the application
4. Make changes to `index.html` and refresh browser to see updates

### Testing Your Changes
- **Functionality**: Test all interactive elements (particles, buttons, hover effects)
- **Responsiveness**: Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Performance**: Ensure animations run smoothly without lag
- **Accessibility**: Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Cross-browser**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## Common Code Patterns & Examples

### Adding a New Interactive Element
```javascript
// Follow this pattern for new interactive components
function newCosmicFeature() {
    console.log('Initializing new cosmic feature...');
    // Add your logic here
    // Use alert() for user feedback during development
    alert('New feature activated!');
}
```

### CSS Animation Pattern
```css
/* Use this pattern for cosmic animations */
.cosmic-element {
    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
    transform: translateY(0);
}

.cosmic-element:hover {
    transform: translateY(-5px);
    box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(243, 156, 18, 0.3);
}
```

### Color Usage Guidelines
```css
/* Primary colors - use these consistently */
--cosmic-gold: #f4d03f;
--cosmic-orange: #f39c12;
--cosmic-dark: #2c3e50;
--cosmic-darker: #1a252f;
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Animations Not Working
- Check browser compatibility (modern browsers required)
- Verify CSS transitions are properly defined
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

### Layout Issues on Mobile
- Test viewport meta tag is present: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
- Use browser dev tools to simulate different screen sizes
- Check responsive breakpoints in CSS media queries

### Particles Not Responding to Mouse
- Verify `mousemove` event listener is attached
- Check particle elements exist in DOM
- Ensure CSS transforms are supported

### Deployment Issues
- Verify all files are committed and pushed to main branch
- Check GitHub Pages settings in repository
- Review GitHub Actions workflow logs for errors

## Code Quality & Linting

The repository uses Super-Linter for automated code quality checks:
- Runs automatically on push to main branch
- Checks HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax
- Validates file formatting and standards
- Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions for any issues

### Manual Linting (Optional)
```bash
# If you want to check code quality locally
npx htmlhint index.html
npx stylelint "**/*.css"
npx eslint "**/*.js"
```
